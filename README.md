# Udacity Capstone Project
#react-docker-aws

In this project, I deployed React Application on docker. I used Open Source Nginx to deploy an application that says "Hello World. My name is Temitayo Ilori."

I used the rolling deployment type.

After creating a Dockerfile, I deployed the application by running a shell script called deploy.sh.

Attached is are screenshots of outputs when deploying the application.
